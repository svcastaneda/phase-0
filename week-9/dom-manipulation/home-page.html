<!-- Add your reflection here -->
<!-- # This challenge took me 0.5 hours. -->
<!--
	What did you learn about the DOM?
		I learned that in order to change an HTML element with a class name, you have to get an array of all class occurrences and specify which index you want to change or write a loop.

	What are some useful methods to use to manipulate the DOM?
		I think that being able to change inner HTML can be really useful if you have a form (like signing up for a newsletter) that users can fill out. Instead of redirecting the user to a thank you page after hitting submit, you can simply change the inner HTML to say "Thank you!"
