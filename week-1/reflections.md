#1.1 Think About Time
I learned about how to effectively build up my confidence by displaying my ability to eventually make myself believe that I can do things and do them well. I also learned about minimum viable products and how all projects should start as one. Another thing that I learned from the articles are new ways to take mental breaks and find inspiration. The new strategies that I read about are meditating and listening to others. I didn’t know that going on a walking, watching the lake, and listening to music could all be considered as meditating!

Time boxing is when you identify a goal and choose a certain amount of work time. You work for that amount of time and then review what was achieved. I can use time boxing in phase 0 by maybe working for 30 minutes to an hour with a goal to finish a task up to a certain point (e.g. work for 30 minutes with the goal of finishing up to step 3). In my review time, I could look at what I found to be difficult, what I found to be easy, what I learned, and reevaluate my goals if needed.

Currently, I manage my time by writing a list of tasks that need to be done, reorder them by priority/deadline, and work for about an hour straight. When I finish a task or that one hour has passed, I take a mental break of about 10 minutes. This usually works for me, unless the task I’m working on is writing a paper for school. I sometimes find it difficult to keep myself motivated, so sometimes I will say to myself “if I finish this by ___, then I will reward myself with ___.”

I am most likely going to continue using my current time management strategy, but add on the concept of time boxing and MVP. I know that my code won’t be perfect at first, but having an MVP is a great start because MVPs work and they can always be improved and expanded upon. Definitely going to use new types of mental breaks instead of just watching TV.

#1.2 The Command Line
A shell is a user interface where you can interact with the computer’s operating system. Bash (Bourne Again Shell) is a standard type of command line interface. The most challenging this for me was remembering all of the different Unix commands. But, after practicing using the terminal, using the commands became easier and sort of intuitive. The weirdest one is probably touch because it’s counterintuitive. I kept wanting to write new or create. Another weird command is grep because it's hard to remember that it stands for "Global Regular Expression Parser," so remembering that it is a search command is difficult. I was able to successfully use all of the commands. I believe that the most important commands and arguments to know are cd (change directory), ls (list stuff), and ../ because they allow you to navigate through your files and folders a lot more quickly than having to click through everything.


| Command | Action                                |
| ------- | ------------------------------------- |
| pwd     | print working directory               |
| ls      | list everything in current directory  |
| mv      | move item                             |
| cd      | change directory                      |
| ../     | parent directory                      |
| touch   | make a new file                       |
| mkdir   | make a new directory                  |
| less    | view/open a file                      |
| rmdir   | delete a directory                    |
| rm      | delete a file                         |
| help    | help menu                             |


#1.4 Forking and Cloning
I would give newbies the following instructions (pictures would be included, but aren't shown here):

##How to create a new repo
Repositories are where you can view your project files on Github and allow collaboration.
1. Sign into your Github account if you haven’t already done so.
2. Click on the plus sign in the upper righthand corner next to your avatar, then click New repository.
3. Give your repository a name.
4. Choose if you want your repository to be public or private.
5. Click on the checkbox next to Initialize this repository with a README.
5. Pick a license type for your repository (MIT is recommended).


##How to fork a repo
Forking is when you create a copy of the existing repository into your account. This allows you to create your own unique version of the project. You can also send pull requests if and when you want to merge your changes with the original repository.
1. Go to the repository that you want to fork (make a copy of into your own account).
2. To fork the project without adding any new files right away, click on Fork in the upper righthand corner under the top navigation bar.
3. To fork the project and add a new file, click on the plus sign next the current repository directory’s name.


##How to clone a repo
Cloning repositories means to download a copy of all of the files in a repository onto your device. This allows you to make changes on your computer, which you can push back to Github in order to merge your local files with the master branch.
1. Go to the repository that you want to clone. If you forked that repository, go to your copy.
2. In the righthand sidebar, look for “HTTPS clone URL”.
3. Click on the clipboard icon. This will copy the URL for you.
4. Open your shell and go into the directory where you want the clone to go.
5. Type git clone COPIED_URL_GOES_HERE. This should create a new directory with all of the files from the repository.


I already had git and GitHub setup prior to phase 0. But I learned why forking and creating branches are important and useful. Before, I would simply push all of my changes to the master branch on the original repository. Now, I know how I can contribute to open source projects (fork the repository), how to keep new features and addons organized (create a branch), and how to merge changes.
