##[GitHub IO Repo](https://github.com/svcastaneda/svcastaneda.github.io)

###Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

###Describe what open source means.
Saying that a project is open source means that anyone can make changes to the files. This could either be to make their own unique version or to collaborate/contribute with the project. But it's important to remember that open source DOES NOT mean free.

###What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
I think that open source is great. It allows companies and organizations to post their code online and get help from other people. It's also great for developers because it gives them a chance to practice their coding and/or documentation skills while helping others. It's a little intimidating to me because I have no idea how to find an open source project that interests me and I definitely don't know how to find one that not only matches my skill level, but also still challenges me so that I can learn in the process.

###Assess the importance of using licenses.
Licenses specify when and how a person can use the files that you have uploaded onto GitHub. What I mean by that is that you can decide if your code can be modified, distributed, patented, or used commercially. This keeps others from stealing your code without giving you credit. You can use this online tool called [Choose A License](http://choosealicense.com/), which helps you determine what license type you should choose.

###What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
I struggled with creating branches, merging with the master branch, making pull requests, and merging pull requests. I'm still practicing going through this process so that it'll be easier in the future.

###Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
I looked at the [GitHub git cheat sheet](https://training.github.com/kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf) to see what the different git commands are and what they do. I thought it was really helpful and well-written.
