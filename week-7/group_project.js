// Method 1:
// 1. define a method called sum that takes in an array of numbers
// 2. create a variable called total and set it equal to 0
// 3. iterate through numbers array
// 4. add each number to total
// 5. return total


// Method 2:
// 1. define a method called mean that takes in an array of numbers
// 2. create a variable called total and set it equal to the given array with the sum method applied to it
// 3. return total divided by the length of the array


// Method 3:
// 1. define a function called "median" that takes in an array of numbers
// 2. sort the array with the sort() method
// 4. create a variable called middle and set it equal to the array length-1 divided by 2
// 3. if the array has an even amount of items, return an array that contains the middle 2 numbers by using floor & ceiling
//		else, return an array that contains the element with the index equal to middle
