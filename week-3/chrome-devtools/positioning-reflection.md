####How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?
I can use Chrome's DevTools to have a live view of my website so that I may mess around with certain CSS element attributes. For example, instead of changing the width of something in my CSS file and refreshing until I'm satisfied, I can go into Chrome and the width would update instantly. Chrome DevTools also help users find an HTML element easily with the finder tool or by hovering over the different HTML tags in the Elements tab.

####How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?
You can resize elements with a width and/or height CSS attribute. You can use pt, px, em, or % to specify the size. pt and px are both fixed numbers, while em and % are responsive, which means that the size changes depending on the font size.

####What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?
- Absolute: Positions the element in a specific position that is relative to its closest ancestor or parent element. Can have margins that won't affect other margins.
- Fixed: Positions the element in a specified position relative to the screen and doesn't move when the user scrolls. If the user prints the HTML page, fixed elements will show up on each page.
- Static: Default attribute value. Can not use top, right, bottom, left, or z-indexes.
- Relative: Adjusts position without changing layout.

I found fixed and absolute to be really weird to use just because they aren't responsive like static or relative positioning. I can imagine using fixed positioning for things like headers and footers, but not for anything else.

####What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?
- Margin: Adds space outside of the element.
- Border: Adds space in the form of a line right along the element.
- Padding: Adds space inside of the element between the border and the content.


####What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)
I loved the challenge because it was good practice to see how positioning works in CSS, which is one of the hardest things to do (in my opinion).
