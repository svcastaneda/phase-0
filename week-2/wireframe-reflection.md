####What is a wireframe?
Wireframing is when you draw out the layout/template of each page type for your website. Wireframes are not detailed, but rather show where everything would go using shapes and labels.

####What are the benefits of wireframing?
Wireframing allows you to quickly draw up a goal template for you site before you start to create it so that you don't waste your time trying to rearrange things with code. since it's a drawing, you it is a quick task that allows the client to approve a design layout before you start to code it.

####Did you enjoy wireframing your site?
I did because I always like going in with a plan. 

####Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?
I revised it. I was originally thinking about making the Home Page the About Me section, but thought that it might confuse the user. So, I changed it to have a short blurb of the website and a picture of myself. I also changed the location of the social media links. They were originally in the footer section, but I moved them closer to the top so that they are easily noticed.
