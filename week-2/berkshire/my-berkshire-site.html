<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
  It wasn't that difficult because I've worked a lot with HTML and CSS in the past.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
  I absolutely love W3Schools. Its layout is very clear, which makes it so much easier to find things. I learned about the <hr> tag, which is how I was able to get the lines on the page.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
  I think I did fairly well because I was able to center everything without using inline CSS using the <center> tags, but I'll change that later with CSS.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
  Good: Easy to use. Like a website's skeleton. It's clear to see where everything will go because the page loads everything in order.
  Bad: Allows inline CSS, which can get messy. Trying get everything placed in the right spot can be tricky. Your HTML may end up looking messy if you have to use a lot of divs and/or tables to accomplish this task.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
  I just try to not overthink things because tag names are usually intuitive and shorthand for something. Need to make a header? Use a <header> tag! Need an image? Use the <img> tag!
