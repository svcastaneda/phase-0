// Refactored Solution






// __________________________________________
// Reflection
// What did you learn about iterating over nested objects in JavaScript?
// I think it's better to create new variable for each nested object so that you 
// can keep your thoughts and code organized.
//
// Were you able to find useful methods to help you with this?
// 
//
// What concepts were solidified in the process of working through this challenge?
// Iterating through hashes and comparing/getting the values.
